# ssl.conf: openssl configuration used for the mentioned commands
# ca.key: Certificate Authority private key file (this shouldn't be shared in real-life)
# ca.crt: Certificate Authority trust certificate
# server.key: Server private key, password protected (this shouldn't be shared)
# server.csr: Server certificate signing request
# server.crt: Server certificate signed by the CA

# Step 1: Generate Certificate Authority + Trust Certificate (ca.crt)
openssl genrsa -passout file:capassfile -aes256 -out ca.key 4096
openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key ca.key -out ca.crt -config ssl.conf

# Step 2: Generate the Server Private Key (server.key)
openssl genrsa -out server.key 4096

# Step 3: Get a certificate signing request from the CA (server.csr)
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr -config ssl.conf

# Step 4: Sign the certificate with the CA we created (it's called self signing) - server.crt
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out server.crt -extensions req_ext -extfile ssl.conf
